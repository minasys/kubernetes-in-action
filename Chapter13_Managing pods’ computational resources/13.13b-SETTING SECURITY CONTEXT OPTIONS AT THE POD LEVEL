SETTING SECURITY CONTEXT OPTIONS AT THE POD LEVEL:
#=================================================
In all these examples, you’ve set the security context of an individual container. Several
of these options can also be set at the pod level (through the pod.spec.security-
Context property). They serve as a default for all the pod’s containers but can be

additional properties, which we’ll explain next.
