# Using the host’s PID and IPC namespaces

# Similar to the hostNetwork option are the hostPID and hostIPC pod spec properties.
#When you set them to true, the pod’s containers will use the node’s PID and IPC
#namespaces, allowing processes running in the containers to see all the other processes
#on the node or communicate with them through IPC, respectively.
